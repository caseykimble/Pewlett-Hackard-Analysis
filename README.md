# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

### Overview

I was asked to perform a data analysis for Pewlett Hackard to anticipate the number of employees that will be retiring over the next several years. After that analysis I was asked to create a table of employees who would be eligible for the mentorship program to fill the roles of retiring employees. I used SQL in PGAdmin to create an ERD and database which assisted me in joining and sorting tables to find the required information. 

### Results

* Pewlett Hackard can expect over 72,000 employees to retire over the next few years across all departments.

* Many retirees are senior employees and project managers. This will be an added challenge simply due to the value and experience that senior employees bring to their team.

* While Pewlett Hackard does have employees they can anticipate filling these roles from their mentorship program, there are only about 1500 eligible which will come nowhere near the amount of employees needed for the 70,000 spots left to fill by retirees.

* Pewlett Hackard will need to begin an agressive external hiring program with 70,000 roles to fill.

### Summary

Pewlett Hackard will need to put together an external hiring program to fill the roles of almost all of these 72,000 expected retirees. Considering they are expecting these employees to retire in the next few years, they will need an aggressive hiring program if they plan on having these current employees train and support the new hires in these roles. With only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program, Pewlett Hackard may need to look into their requirements for this program and loosen the requirements needed for eligibility. That may help with the inevitable shortage they will see in the next few years, as the company would benefit more from promoting within versus outside hires. Otherwise they are looking at a need to create hiring incentives to fill these jobs in a very competitive tech job market.
